## Role
- A Role always sets permissions within a particular namespace
- Here’s an example Role in the “default” namespace that can be used to grant read access to pods:

		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: Role
		metadata:
		  namespace: default
		  name: pod-reader
		rules:
		- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
		  resources: ["pods"]
		  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

## ClusterRole
- By contrast, is a non-namespaced resource
- ClusterRoles have several uses. You can use a ClusterRole to:
	* define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted within individual namespace(s)
	* define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted across all namespaces
	* define permissions on cluster-scoped resources
- A ClusterRole can be used to grant the same permissions as a Role. Because ClusterRoles are cluster-scoped, you can also use them to grant access to:
	* cluster-scoped resources (like nodes)
	* non-resource endpoints (like /healthz)
	* namespaced resources (like Pods), across all namespaces For example: you can use a ClusterRole to allow a particular user to run kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
- Here is an example of a ClusterRole that can be used to grant read access to secrets in any particular namespace, or across all namespaces (depending on how it is bound):

		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: ClusterRole
		metadata:
		  # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
		  name: secret-reader
		rules:
		- apiGroups: [""]
		  #
		  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Secret
		  # objects is "secrets"
		  resources: ["secrets"]
		  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]


## RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding
A role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted. A RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a ClusterRoleBinding grants that access cluster-wide.
