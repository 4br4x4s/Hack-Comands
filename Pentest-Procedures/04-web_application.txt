	## How to pentest web aplication procedures
	1 - Walking the web applicaiton. Review al functionalities, paths and content
	2 - Content Discovery: Robots, sitmap, HTTP headers, Framwork, OSSINT, Google Dorks
	3 - Subdomain enumeration:
			> OSINT: SSL/TLS Certs
			> OSINT: SearchEngines
			> Bruteforce: Dnsrecon
			> Sublist3r
			> Virtual Host
	4 - Autenticaction Bypass
			> Creating list of potential users
			> Userenumeration in singup and login
			> Bruteforce with know passwords
			> Logic Flaw
			> Cookie Tampering
	5 - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
			> Search in: URLs, base64 strings, hashs strings
			> Create two users and review diferenct content
	6 - File Inclusion
			> LFI (Local File Inclusion), RFI (Remote File Inclusion), Directory Transversal
			> Path Transversal or Directory transversal
				* Allow read file content from other system directories
				* file_get_contents - PHP Potential Vulnerable function
			> LFI
			    * I could find both in the parameters of the query and in the body as well as in cookies.
			    	> If test GET try url query
			    	> If test POST use body param
				* Bypass develop adding extension ass .php with NULL BYTE %00 or 0x00
						- WARNING! is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above
				* If there is an specific filter for specific paths like "/etc/passwd" its posible to add "/."" or "/../passwd" at the end to bypass it.
				* If there is a replacement for "../" its posible to bypass with "....//....//"
				* If there is a control for specifyc path read, it is posible to bypass by adding this path at the beginin "specific path ../../../etc/passwd"
			> RFI
				* RFI occurs when improperly sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL into include function.
	7 - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
			> Where to finde:
				* URL is used in a parameter
				* Hidden field in form
				* Hostname in a parameter
				* Paths in params
			> At the end of the query add "&x=" to finish the query and start another
